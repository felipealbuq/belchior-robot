## Getting Started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/felipealbuq/BelchiorRobot.git
```

You can open the file BelchiorRobot.blend in the objects folder to see the results on Blender and make changes if you want. In this project, textures, shading and animations were worked on.

## Project Objective 

The objective of this project is to provide a fully **articulated 3D robot** model with detailed **textures**, realistic **shading**, and smooth **animations**, ready to be integrated into any **Blender** project or **game**. The goals of this project include:

- Showcasing my skills in **3D modeling** and **rigging** to create a highly articulated robot with lifelike movement.
- Using advanced **texturing** and **shading techniques** to add realism and visual depth to the robot model.
- Implementing some **animations**, such as walking and idle movements, and action sequences, to make the robot ready for various scenarios in games or animations.
- Ensuring compatibility with **Blender** and other game engines, allowing for seamless integration into different 3D projects or interactive applications. In this case, use the three js library to manipulate the 3D object on the web.

This project demonstrates my ability to create versatile and detailed 3D assets that can be directly used in **animation** or **game development**, providing a complete, action-ready character.
